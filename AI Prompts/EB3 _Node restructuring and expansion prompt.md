<execution_steps>
## STEP 1: Information Discovery
### Substep 1.1: Source Identification
- Identify all technologies, instruments, methods, and institutions mentioned in input
- Create priority list based on unfamiliarity and importance to content
- Map each item to appropriate authorized source category

### Substep 1.2: Hierarchical Research
- Search primary sources (official Node websites) first
- Progress to institutional sources (university department pages)
- Consult academic sources (PubMed, Google Scholar) for technical details
- Access scientific databases (EMBL, EBI, Wellcome) for specialized information

### Substep 1.3: Information Validation
- Cross-reference findings across multiple authorized sources
- Verify technical specifications and capabilities
- Confirm institutional affiliations and geographical details
- Document source quality and reliability for each piece of information

## STEP 2: Content Analysis and Planning
### Substep 2.1: Input Text Parsing
- Analyze existing content structure and identify strengths/weaknesses
- Locate "Offered Technologies" table for exact preservation
- Assess completeness of each mandatory section
- Identify gaps requiring research-based expansion

### Substep 2.2: Content Strategy Development
- Plan paragraph structure for each section based on available information
- Determine integration points for researched background context
- Identify opportunities for technical explanation enhancement
- Map logical flow connections between sections

### Substep 2.3: Quality Standards Preparation
- Review prohibited phrases and structures for avoidance
- Confirm target audience requirements (undergraduate/early postgraduate level)
- Prepare formal, neutral tone guidelines for consistent application

## STEP 3: Content Transformation
### Substep 3.1: Section-by-Section Rewriting
- **Description**: Craft mission overview with institutional context and network positioning
- **Offered Technologies**: PRESERVE table exactly without modification
- **Instrument Highlights**: Expand technical capabilities with application context
- **Additional Services**: Detail support offerings with real-world examples
- **Contact Details**: Verify and format contact information accurately

### Substep 3.2: Research Integration
- Seamlessly weave background information into existing content
- Explain technical terms and methods for target audience comprehension
- Add contextual significance for imaging applications and user benefits
- Maintain natural narrative flow without fact-dumping

### Substep 3.3: Language Refinement
- Apply formal, precise scientific language throughout
- Eliminate prohibited phrases and robotic constructions
- Ensure paragraph-only formatting (no bullet points except preserved table)
- Maintain engaging narrative without personal pronouns or subjective language

## STEP 4: Final Validation and Output
### Substep 4.1: Structure Compliance Verification
- Confirm exact section order and header formatting
- Verify "Offered Technologies" table preservation
- Check paragraph formatting consistency across all sections
- Validate absence of bullet points outside preserved table

### Substep 4.2: Content Quality Assurance
