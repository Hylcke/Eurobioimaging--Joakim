This study employed a structured AI-assisted content processing framework using EB-2, a specialized prompt engineering system designed for scientific content refinement. Following established guidelines for AI disclosure in academic methodology, the framework implements a systematic four-step transformation pipeline: Information Discovery, Content Analysis and Planning, Content Transformation, and Final Validation.



The EB-2 system operates through hierarchical research protocols that prioritize primary sources (official institutional websites), secondary sources (peer-reviewed academic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar), and tertiary verification through cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources. This approach ensures transparency and reproducibility while maintaining scientific integrity. Each processing step incorporates explicit quality control mechanisms, including factual accuracy verification, citation validation, and adherence to predetermined content structure requirements.



The prompt engineering methodology leverages natural language processing capabilities to enhance clarity and technical precision while preserving original research content. Critical constraints prevent AI-generated content creation, instead focusing on content refinement, contextual enhancement, and structural optimization. All outputs undergo manual validation to ensure alignment with Euro-BioImaging editorial standards and scientific communication best practices. This methodology addresses the growing need for transparent AI use in academic content development while maintaining rigorous quality control standards essential for scientific publication.
