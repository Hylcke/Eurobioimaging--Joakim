This study implemented a specialized AI-assisted documentation framework for generating standardized Euro-BioImaging technology entries. The methodology employs a structured prompt engineering system designed to create consistent, technically accurate infrastructure submissions while maintaining strict adherence to predefined template schemas and formatting requirements.



The framework operates through a seven-phase execution protocol: Research Phase utilizing hierarchical search strategies across primary sources (manufacturer documentation), academic databases (peer-reviewed publications), institutional repositories (university facility pages), and community resources (user guides, application notes). The Verification Phase implements cross-referencing protocols across multiple independent sources to ensure factual accuracy. Documentation and Structure Phases enforce mandatory template compliance, preserving exact section ordering, heading structure, and separator formatting. Quality and Validation Phases incorporate source attribution verification and institutional information currency checks.



Critical methodological constraints prevent content modification outside designated placeholder fields, eliminate promotional language, and mandate technical accuracy through evidence-based content generation. The system incorporates comprehensive research protocols prioritizing official documentation, peer-reviewed literature, and verified institutional information while encouraging inclusion of confirmed researcher names, facility specifications, and documented case studies. This methodology ensures reproducible, standardized outputs that maintain Euro-BioImaging's network-wide documentation consistency while preserving scientific rigor and institutional transparency.
