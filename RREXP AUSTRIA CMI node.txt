## Description

Austrian BioImaging/CMI is Austria‚Äôs national multimodal Euro-BioImaging Node, operating as a geographically distributed consortium comprising eight leading academic and research institutions across the country. The Node offers coordinated access to an exceptionally broad portfolio of imaging technologies, covering the full spatial and temporal resolution spectrum‚Äîfrom molecular to whole-organism imaging. Modalities range from cryo-electron and advanced fluorescence microscopy to multimodal preclinical imaging systems such as micro-MRI, micro-PET, and micro-CT. 

The Node supports imaging across all biological sample types and conditions, including in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo contexts. This flexibility allows users from basic, translational, and applied biosciences to explore dynamic cellular processes, tissue organisation, functional anatomy, and molecular composition. With over 30 established imaging techniques and a strong emphasis on correlative workflows, Austrian BioImaging/CMI facilitates integrative, multiscale biological analysis.

Alongside physical access, the Node provides dedicated services in image data processing, analysis, visualisation, and data stewardship. Expertise includes quantitative image analysis pipelines and solutions for complex, multidimensional datasets. 

Among the Node‚Äôs specialised technologies are Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), micro X-ray Fluorescence (micro-XRF), Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI), Brillouin Light Scattering Microscopy, and High-Resolution Episcopic Microscopy (HREM). These methods enable label-free, mechanical, chemical, and 3D structural imaging across diverse sample types. Austrian BioImaging/CMI also provides access to a high-throughput, non-invasive phenotyping platform for mid-sized crop plants, which supports functional and developmental studies in plant biology.

The consortium is actively involved in the development and validation of novel imaging tools and protocols for both research and clinical translation. A key area of innovation is the design and implementation of correlative multimodality workflows, where complementary imaging methods are combined to yield integrated, high-resolution, and functionally rich datasets. This positions Austrian BioImaging/CMI as a leader in advancing imaging technologies for systems-level biomedical research.
