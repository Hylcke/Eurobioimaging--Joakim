## Description

Danish BioImaging (DBI) is a multi-sited, multimodal Euro-BioImaging Node that brings together five nationally distributed imaging facilities, forming a coordinated infrastructure for life science and biomedical research across Denmark. Hosted by major academic institutions, including the University of Copenhagen and Aarhus University, the Node offers researchers access to a comprehensive array of imaging platforms that span from molecular-scale microscopy to whole-organism and preclinical imaging. Its technologies support a wide range of research domains, including **plant biology, pathology, neuroscience, and metabolic disease**. 

DBI also coordinates the national Image Analysis Core Facility (IACF), which provides researchers with services in **image data management**, processing, and quantitative analysis. By integrating high-end imaging instruments, expert consultation, and training within a unified national framework, DBI plays a central role in Denmark’s research infrastructure and contributes to the wider European imaging community through Euro-BioImaging.

## Instrument Highlights

Danish BioImaging provides access to a wide array of state-of-the-art imaging systems that address spatial scales ranging from single molecules to whole organisms. 

### **Preclinical Imaging Facilities**

Among the Node’s preclinical platforms are high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound imaging, including 4D modalities for **dynamic cardiac and vascular studies**. These instruments are supported by Denmark’s leading experimental large-animal research infrastructure, particularly for **porcine models**, allowing translational research that bridges animal and human biology.

### **Light Microscopy and Molecular Imaging**
For molecular and cellular imaging, DBI hosts super-resolution modalities such as STED (Stimulated Emission Depletion), which achieves sub-diffraction resolution by selectively deactivating fluorescence in a targeted region, and SMLM (Single Molecule Localization Microscopy), including techniques like PALM and STORM, which localize individual fluorescent molecules with nanometer precision. Techniques such as FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) and CARS (Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering) enable label-free chemical mapping and fluorescence dynamics measurements. Spatial transcriptomics with MERFISH allows single-cell mapping of RNA molecules across tissues, enabling integrative genomics and imaging approaches.

### **Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM)**
In electron microscopy, the Node provides cryo-TEM for near-native structure determination of macromolecular complexes, Tokuyasu and resin-section immunogold labeling for protein localization, and 3D volume imaging via FIB-SEM and SBF-SEM. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) pipelines are available to bridge functional fluorescence microscopy with high-resolution ultrastructure.

The Node also supports light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (SPIM), which enables rapid 3D imaging of living tissues with minimal phototoxicity, and image scanning microscopy (ISM), which enhances resolution while maintaining optical sectioning. Collectively, these tools support high-throughput, quantitative analysis of morphology, molecular interactions, and tissue-level organization.
