## Instrument Highlights

The Node hosts high-resolution confocal microscopes (e.g., Zeiss LSM), fast live-cell systems (e.g., spinning disk), and deep tissue imaging (two-photon). Super-resolution is available via STED and SMLM. Light-sheet and electron microscopes (TEM, SEM) support multi-scale analysis.  

## Specialties and Expertise of the Node

The Node provides expertise in advanced fluorescence imaging (FRET, FRAP, FLIM), molecular interaction studies, and high-throughput phenotyping. EM techniques such as array tomography and immunogold EM enable ultrastructural analysis. Staff support includes experiment planning, imaging, and analysis.  


## Additional Services

Services include sample prep (tissue clearing, immunolabelling), microscopy training, user support, and data analysis tools. Researchers receive technical advice and access to processing software for quantitative evaluation.
