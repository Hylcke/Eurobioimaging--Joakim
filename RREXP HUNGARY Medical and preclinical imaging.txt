## Instrument Highlights

The Node includes MiniPET, NanoPET-MRI, and nano-SPECT-CT scanners for preclinical studies. Clinical systems include PET/SPECT-CT. A Bruker PharmaScan 4.7T MRI is available for small-animal imaging. Leica CM3600 cryomacrotome and a phosphor imager are used for high-resolution autoradiography. One site houses PET, MRI, SPECT, and CT in a single room for multimodal preclinical imaging. A 16 MeV cyclotron supports in-house radioisotope production beyond conventional PET tracers.
