## Description  
The Israel BioImaging Node is a multi-sited, multimodal Euro-BioImaging infrastructure that **spans seven premier Israeli research institutions**: 
1. Weizmann Institute of Science
2. Tel Aviv University, Technion
3. Hebrew University of Jerusalem
4. Ben-Gurion University of the Negev
5. Bar-Ilan University
6. University of Haifa

It provides open access to a comprehensive spectrum of biological, molecular, and medical imaging technologies. A defining feature of the Node is its facilitation of cross-modality imaging workflows across spatial scales, enabling seamless correlation from single-molecule and cellular resolution to whole-animal *in vivo* and clinical imaging. This integrative approach supports advanced translational and systems-level biomedical research. 

The Nodeâ€™s strategic structure also fosters access to highly specialised domains, including **underwater and marine microscopy**, making it a key contributor to the Euro-BioImaging network in areas ranging from basic biology to applied environmental imaging.

## Instrument Highlights  

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
The Node offers high-field MRI systems capable of â‰¥7â€¯T imaging, enabling ultra-high-resolution visualisation of soft tissues, functional processes, and vascular networks, supporting both preclinical and clinical applications. 

### Electron microscopes (EM)
Its comprehensive electron microscopy capabilities include chemically fixed and cryo-preserved TEM, cryo-SEM, and multiple modes of CLEM (pre-embed and in-section), permitting nanoscale structural analysis combined with fluorescence-based molecular localisation. 

### Light and fluorescence microscopy
Light microscopy platforms span confocal (point scanning and spinning-disk), total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), multiphoton, and super-resolution techniques such as STED and SMLM. These systems support live-cell imaging, high-speed volumetric acquisition, and sub-diffraction molecular resolution. Light-sheet mesoscopy enables rapid, low-phototoxicity imaging of large, intact biological samples. 

### Environmental and special conditions microscopy 
The Node also supports specialised applications such as underwater and marine microscopy, facilitating research on deep-sea organisms and coral systems in both Mediterranean and Red Sea environments.

## Additional Services  
The Node offers extensive support for imaging workflows, including project planning, methodological consultation, and access to dedicated wet laboratories, cell culture facilities, and small-animal housing. 

Specialised resources include access to **custom-developed imaging probes and molecular tracers**. End-to-end data processing services are provided, encompassing image pre-processing, advanced analysis, visualisation, and secure storage. Support for **advanced computation is available for users working with large-scale and multimodal datasets**, particularly in high-throughput or super-resolution contexts. Training programmes are available at multiple levels, ranging from introductory workshops to advanced technical courses. 

Remote access and sample submission are available at several hosting sites, and experimental co-design is supported in close collaboration with local facility experts.
