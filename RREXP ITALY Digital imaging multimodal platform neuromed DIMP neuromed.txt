## Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed - DIMP NEUROMED

---

## Description

The **Digital Imaging Multimodal Platform Neuromed (DIMP NEUROMED)** is a single-sited, multimodal Node hosted by the IRCCS Neuromed Institute in Pozzilli, Italy. This Node provides an integrated imaging and data analysis infrastructure that supports both **preclinical and clinical studies**, with a strong emphasis on translational **neuroscience and oncology**. It facilitates the entire research pipeline, from the evaluation of disease models in animals to the classification of human clinical cases, bridging the gap between laboratory discovery and clinical application.

Operating as part of the Euro-BioImaging network, DIMP NEUROMED enables access to a broad range of multimodal imaging technologies, including **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and optical imaging**. These systems are embedded within a high-performance computational framework that supports the extraction of quantitative imaging biomarkers. 

The Node also hosts a **large-scale image database** comprising preclinical and clinical datasets, which can be used to **develop and test artificial intelligence-driven analysis** pipelines, particularly those based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Instrument Highlights

*Micro PET/CT for small animal and plant models*

The Node houses a comprehensive suite of advanced functional and molecular imaging instruments designed to address complex research challenges in neurology and oncology. One of its central technologies is the **Digital microPET/CT scanner (RAYCAN E180)**, which is unique in Europe. This system offers exceptionally high sensitivity and enables dynamic functional imaging at temporal resolutions as short as 30 seconds. It is particularly suited for studies requiring kinetic modelling of radiotracer distribution, such as those assessing **tumour metabolism or neurotransmitter dynamics**.

A **7 Tesla preclinical MRI system** is also available, offering **high-resolution anatomical and functional imaging of small animals**. These imaging modalities are complemented by in-house software development efforts at Neuromed, where dedicated algorithms are created for image reconstruction, statistical analysis, and texture-based biomarker extraction. These include pipelines for brain segmentation, pattern recognition, and clinical classification based on imaging phenotypes.

To support the scale and complexity of data generated, the platform integrates one of Europeâ€™s most advanced **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** systems based on **Memory Driven Computing** architecture, developed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise. This system is optimised for large datasets from population imaging studies and multi-omics analyses. In addition, Neuromed offers access to **iPLAT**, its proprietary digital imaging platform that incorporates deep learning-based diagnostic tools. These **CNN-based algorithms** are designed for classifying medical images in neurodegenerative and oncological diseases, providing AI-powered support for early detection and patient stratification.

DIMP NEUROMED offers a fully integrated research support ecosystem, beginning with assistance in project planning and experimental design. Users can access wet laboratory space, cell culture suites, and dedicated facilities for animal housing and handling. 

For radiotracer-based studies, the Node includes chemistry and radiochemistry laboratories capable of producing customised molecular probes. Biobanking infrastructure is also available for the collection and storage of biological specimens linked to imaging datasets.

Advanced computational resources enable end-to-end support for data processing, quantitative analysis, and secure storage. Researchers may either perform their experiments onsite or remotely analyse datasets from Neuromedâ€™s extensive preclinical and clinical image repository. 

Support for machine learning model development, algorithm benchmarking, and collaborative data annotation is available to both academic and industrial users. Training is offered at multiple levels, from introductory sessions to advanced courses in imaging analysis and artificial intelligence.
