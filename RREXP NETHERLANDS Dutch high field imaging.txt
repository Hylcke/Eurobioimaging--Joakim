## Dutch High Field Imaging Hub

## Description

The Dutch High Field Imaging Hub is a multi-sited, single-modality Node within the Euro-BioImaging network, offering advanced high-field MRI infrastructure dedicated to human imaging. It is a national consortium composed of five imaging centers across the Netherlands, each contributing unique capabilities to a shared mission: to drive innovation in precision MRI for both medical diagnostics and neuroscience research.

Each center is equipped with ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems operating at â‰¥7 Tesla (T), enabling ultra-high resolution imaging of the brain, spine, breast, heart, abdomen, and extremities. The increased magnetic field strength significantly improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and allows the use of novel contrast mechanisms that are not feasible at lower field strengths. These properties are particularly valuable in detecting subtle pathological changes, enhancing both anatomical and functional imaging.

The five centers collaborate closely by harmonizing imaging protocols, co-developing RF coil technologies, and building shared data processing pipelines. Through these efforts, the Hub ensures methodological consistency while allowing innovation and flexibility across different research applications. Its open-access framework invites external academic and clinical users to benefit from its state-of-the-art infrastructure and expertise.

## Instrument Highlights

Beyond the baseline use of 7T MRI, the Dutch High Field Imaging Hub offers access to several unique imaging platforms:

One of the participating centers hosts a 9.4 Tesla MRI system approved for human brain studies. This instrument represents one of the highest magnetic field strengths currently used in clinical-grade imaging worldwide. It enables ultra-fine spatial resolution and supports a range of specialized sequences, including:

- Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) imaging for functional MRI (fMRI)
- Vascular Space Occupancy (VASO) imaging to assess cerebral blood volume
- High-resolution structural imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)

Another site focuses on metabolic MRI and spectroscopy, employing custom-designed RF coils tuned to multiple nuclei. For instance:

- **Quintuple-tuned head coils** allow signal detection from five different atomic nucleiâ€”^1H (proton), ^31P (phosphorus), ^23Na (sodium), ^13C (carbon), and ^19F (fluorine)â€”enabling comprehensive metabolic and physiological characterization within a single scan session.
- **Multi-tuned body coils** are used for ^31P MRSI (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging), allowing real-time metabolic imaging of tissues such as liver and muscle.

These instruments integrate both transmission and reception coils tailored to specific isotopes, with multi-channel arrays to support parallel imaging. The ability to measure non-proton nuclei adds a biochemical dimension to imaging, such as capturing high-energy phosphate metabolism (^31P), sodium gradients (^23Na), and carbon fluxes (^13C) in vivo.

All sites support full-body and brain imaging, providing robust anatomical, functional, and metabolic imaging across a wide range of clinical and research applications.

## Specialties and Expertise of the Node

The Dutch High Field Imaging Hub is internationally recognized for its specialization in ultra-high field MRI, with specific focus areas including:

- **Neuroscience**: Detailed brain mapping using BOLD and VASO fMRI, layer-specific imaging, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM).
- **Metabolic Imaging**: In vivo spectroscopy using ^31P, ^13C, and ^23Na to assess energy metabolism, cellular viability, and ion transport.
- **RF Coil Engineering**: Custom development of multi-nuclear, multi-tuned coils in collaboration with industrial partners.
- **Multi-nuclear Imaging**: Expertise in integrating multiple isotope signals within single or consecutive scan sessions, enhancing the biological information available from MRI.

The Node plays a pivotal role in enabling high-resolution, non-invasive studies of tissue function, metabolism, and microstructure, contributing to advances in both clinical and translational research.
