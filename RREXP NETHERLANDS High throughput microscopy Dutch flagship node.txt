## High Throughput Microscopy Dutch Flagship Node

## Description

The Dutch High Throughput Microscopy (NL-HTM) Flagship Node unites three premier screening centres in the Netherlands—Leiden Cell Observatory, the Cell Screening Center (CSC) at UMC Utrecht, and the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)—each offering complementary strengths in cell-based assays, high-content imaging, and automated microscopy. Together, they form a globally recognised centre for imaging-based, high-throughput biomedical screening.

The **Leiden Cell Observatory** integrates high-end automated live-cell confocal microscopy with compound and RNA interference (RNAi) screening strategies. It plays a leading role in dynamic cellular imaging and systems microscopy and is closely tied to translational research in cancer biology, toxicology, and pharmacology.

The **Cell Screening Center (CSC)**, based at UMC Utrecht, operates automated microscopy platforms for high-throughput imaging using multi-well plates. It specialises in functional screening with siRNA and small molecules, focusing on stem cell biology, neurodegeneration, and paediatric disorders.

The **NKI Screening Center** offers whole-genome RNAi screening, using shRNA and siRNA libraries to interrogate gene function on a genome-wide scale. The **NKI Advanced Microscopy Core Facility** further supports this by embedding high-end fluorescence microscopy—including FLIM and FRET—in medium-throughput settings, enabling detailed spatiotemporal studies of live cells.
