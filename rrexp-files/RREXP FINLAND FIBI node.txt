## Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node

---

## Description

The **Finnish Biomedical Imaging Node (FiBI)** is a multi-sited, multimodal Node providing integrated access to cutting-edge biomedical imaging technologies across Finland. Operated through a national collaboration of research centres, the Node supports imaging applications spanning the full translational spectrum, from preclinical animal models to human studies. The Node is hosted at leading Finnish institutions and is recognised as a key contributor to the Academy of Finland’s National Roadmap for Research Infrastructures (2021–2024).

FiBI’s imaging platforms specialise in **nuclear imaging, high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and advanced optical intravital microscopy**. 
These modalities enable research in cardiovascular, metabolic, oncological, and neurological domains. The Node also maintains a **comprehensive repository of validated imaging tracers, functional probes, and tailored stimulation systems for both animal and human use**. 

FiBI operates in close partnership with the Finnish Advanced Light Microscopy Node; together, they form **Euro-BioImaging Finland**, which contributes to the broader Euro-BioImaging infrastructure by offering high-quality, open-access imaging services and expertise to both national and international users.

## Instrument Highlights

The Node offers access to a broad range of high-performance instruments tailored for preclinical and clinical applications. 

### **PET Imaging**  
PET imaging is supported by three full-body PET/CT systems, a hybrid 3T PET/MRI scanner for simultaneous metabolic and anatomical imaging, a brain-specific PET system compatible with both humans and animals, and multiple small-animal PET/CT devices. Portable PET and CT systems enhance flexibility for in-lab or multi-centre studies.

### **Preclinical High-Field MRI**  
Preclinical MRI infrastructure includes four high-field MRI instruments operating at 7T, 9.4T, and 11.5T, offering high-resolution imaging and functional mapping in small animal models. A hyperpolarizer system is available to enable real-time metabolic imaging using hyperpolarized contrast agents. The Node also operates a hybrid 7T PET/MRI platform, enabling concurrent acquisition of molecular and structural data in small animals.

### **Magnetoencephalography (MEG)**  
The MEG facilities include two magnetoencephalography systems paired with high-density EEG arrays for detailed neurophysiological investigations. These are complemented by a dedicated 3T MRI scanner and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) equipment, facilitating multimodal mapping of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions.

### **Optical Intravital Microscopy**  
Optical intravital microscopy works by using specialised light to excite fluorescent molecules within living tissue, allowing specific cells or structures to be visualised in real time. Optical intravital imaging systems include three multiphoton microscopes, widefield fluorescence microscopes, and a whole-body optical imaging platform for luminescence and fluorescence-based tracking in vivo. These systems support longitudinal imaging of tissue-level dynamics in both anaesthetised and behaving animal models.

## Additional Services

The Node provides end-to-end support for both preclinical and clinical imaging studies. Services include assistance with experimental design, animal model selection, and radiotracer or contrast agent development. **Researchers can access a range of genetically defined and disease-specific animal models housed in accredited facilities equipped for advanced surgical and behavioural procedures**.

Support for human imaging includes help with subject recruitment, ethical approval processes, and data integration across modalities. FiBI also offers specialised tools for electrophysiological and behavioural assessments, along with capabilities for blood and tissue sampling and pharmacokinetic analysis. Image processing and quantitative data analysis services are available, as well as robust long-term storage solutions for large imaging datasets. Training and consultation are provided across all major modalities, with programmes tailored for both novice users and experienced researchers.
