## Description

The **Finnish Advanced Microscopy Node (FiAM)** of Euro‚ÄëBioImaging Finland is a nationally coordinated, multi‚Äësite infrastructure operating across Helsinki, Turku, and Oulu, with additional partners in Kuopio and Tampere. Hosted by core university facilities, including Helsinki BioImaging at the University of Helsinki, Turku BioImaging (University of Turku and √Öbo Akademi University), and Oulu BioImaging at the University of Oulu. The FiAM Node provides open‚Äëaccess imaging services to over 800 national and international users annually. 

The Node specialises in advanced **three‚Äëdimensional and correlative imaging**, delivering integrated workflows that encompass image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis across light and electron microscopy modalities. This collaborative capability strengthens

## Instrument Highlights

The Node offers an integrated suite of high-performance imaging systems. 

**Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM)** merges fluorescence or transmitted-light imaging with electron microscopy, enabling precise correlation of molecular localization and ultrastructure‚Äîan essential approach in neurobiology and cellular ultrastructure studies. 

A flagship instrument is the **Leica TCS SP8** confocal platform in Helsinki, equipped with tunable picosecond dual-wavelength sources enabling coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), multi-photon excitation, Second Harmonic Generation (SHG), and Third Harmonic Generation (THG). This system facilitates **label-free chemical imaging of lipids and collagen in live tissues and cryosections at high spatial resolution**. 

**Super-resolution microscopy** is provided by STED (via mirror‚ÄëSTED implementations on the SP8) and SMLM techniques such as STORM and PALM, enabling three-dimensional imaging beyond the diffraction limit and ideal for subcellular structural studies. Mesoscopic 3D and 4D imaging capabilities, such as Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) and Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM), enable volumetric imaging across whole organs or model organisms with minimal phototoxicity and rapid acquisition. 

Collectively, these instruments cater to a broad array of biomedical applications, ranging from developmental biology to extracellular matrix visualization.

## Additional Services

FiAM supports users with end-to-end imaging workflows, including experimental design consultation, instrument operation assistance, and data analysis training. Dedicated technical staff guide users in developing study protocols, standard operating procedures, and interpreting complex imaging data. The Node‚Äôs infrastructure includes access to animal facilities, cell culture suites with **Biosafety Levels 1‚Äì2**, and wet-lab space to support diverse sample preparations. Training seminars are provided at beginner and advanced levels, with advanced courses focused on super-resolution, CLEM methodologies, mesoscopic imaging, and label-free techniques including CARS microscopy. 

Data management services encompass bioimage informatics support, particularly leveraging open-source image-analysis platforms such as BioimageXD and Microscopy Image Browser (MIB), and collaborations with the Centre for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis in Oulu to enable **advanced computer-vision-based image processing**. Remote access and sample-submission workflows are available upon consultation, ensuring flexible access for international users.

### Testimonials
‚ÄúThe cell imaging core facility at Turku University is very well managed with dedicated professional people. The instruments are of high quality and are very well maintained. I was very pleased to be here and I am satisfied by the experience of coming here for a few days and having the imaging done perfectly.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe visit to the Euro-Bioimaging Finnish Node changed the direction of my research in a positive way: I was able to observe the behaviour of my protein of interest in really high resolution using SIR microscopy. The staff were always ready to help and guide me to get the best out of my visit. I highly recommend a visit to the Finnish Node!‚Äù
