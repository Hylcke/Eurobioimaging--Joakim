## Phase Contrast Imaging Flagship Node Trieste

---

## Description

The **Phase Contrast Imaging Flagship Node in Trieste** is hosted at the SYRMEP beamline of the Elettra Synchrotron facility, an advanced synchrotron radiation source located in north-eastern Italy. This Node represents Italy‚Äôs national hub for high-resolution phase contrast X-ray imaging and contributes a unique modality to the Euro-BioImaging network by offering **non-destructive, label-free imaging of biological tissues** with enhanced soft tissue contrast.

Phase contrast imaging takes advantage of the specific properties of synchrotron radiation, including monochromaticity, high flux, and spatial coherence, to detect minute changes in the phase of X-ray beams as they pass through samples. This approach significantly **improves the visibility of features in low-absorbing soft tissues**, which are difficult to visualise using conventional absorption-based radiography. 

The Node's infrastructure supports both propagation-based and analyzer-based phase contrast imaging modalities, offering tailored solutions for a wide range of biomedical applications, from preclinical imaging to biomaterials research.

## Instrument Highlights

The Node is equipped with high-performance imaging platforms that support **multi-scale synchrotron radiation imaging** using propagation-based phase contrast. These systems enable spatial resolutions ranging from 1 ¬µm to 50 ¬µm, adjustable according to sample size and required detail. This flexibility allows precise visualisation of fine anatomical structures and tissue interfaces.

A key instrument is the **Analyzer-Based Imaging (ABI)** setup, which operates in the 15 to 35 keV X-ray energy range using monochromatic beams. This configuration enhances contrast sensitivity for weakly absorbing materials and is particularly useful for quantitative imaging of **soft tissues, cartilage, and pathological specimens**.

The **SYRMEP Tomo Project (STP) software suite** provides advanced pre-processing and reconstruction algorithms that allow optimisation of image quality based on specific experimental needs. These tools support workflows such as ring artifact correction, phase retrieval, and iterative reconstruction.

The Node also includes a versatile experimental station capable of supporting in-situ experiments and custom imaging setups. In addition, the TomoLab facility complements the synchrotron station with a micro-focus X-ray source for standard microCT applications, offering greater flexibility in proposal planning.

## Additional Services

The Phase Contrast Imaging Node offers **full-service imaging pipelines, from sample mounting and acquisition to reconstruction and data post-processing**. Users receive support in experimental design, including guidance on beamline setup and selection of imaging parameters suitable for their biological question.

Advanced data processing is available through proprietary and open-source software tools, such as the **Pore3D library**, which facilitates quantitative analysis of porous and fibrous structures in 3D datasets. Remote access to data, virtual consultation for experimental planning, and assistance with image interpretation are provided on request.

**Training is available** for both new and experienced users, with tailored programmes focused on phase contrast principles, data handling, and 3D image reconstruction. These sessions can be delivered in-person or remotely, depending on user needs and project scope.
