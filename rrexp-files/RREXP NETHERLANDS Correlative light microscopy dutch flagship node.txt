## Correlative Light Microscopy Dutch Flagship Node

---

## Description

The Dutch Correlative Light Electron Microscopy (CLEM) Flagship Node is a high-profile collaboration between four leading Dutch research centers in cellular imaging: the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht, Utrecht University, Leiden University Medical Center, and the University of Groningen. The Node is coordinated by internationally recognized experts in microscopy and cell biology: Judith Klumperman (UMC Utrecht), Hans Gerritsen (Utrecht University), Arie Koster (Leiden University), and Ben Giepmans (University of Groningen).

The Node is globally recognized for advancing the integration of light and electron microscopy through technological development, standardization of protocols, and training. It supports cutting-edge research using CLEM to bridge the molecular specificity of fluorescence microscopy with the ultrastructural detail of electron microscopy. Its infrastructure enables seamless workflows from live-cell imaging to cryo-fixation and EM-based structural analysis, offering broad accessibility and high-end user support under the Euro-BioImaging framework.

## Instrument Highlights

The Dutch CLEM Node is equipped to support complete CLEM workflows, encompassing imaging of live cells, advanced cryo-fixation, ultrathin sectioning, and multi-modal imaging at nanometer resolution. The instrumentation spans across all four partner institutions and is harmonized under a unified access policy.

Available infrastructure includes:
- Cryomicrotomes for sectioning frozen hydrated biological samples with minimal artefacts.
- Dedicated Cryo-EM platforms for structural imaging at near-native conditions.
- Integrated CLEM systems (iCLEM) that enable rapid correlation between fluorescence and EM modalities.
- FIB-SEM instruments with automated acquisition for 3D EM imaging of resin-embedded samples.

Flagship capabilities also include:
- Correlative light-immuno-electron microscopy using Tokuyasu ultrathin cryosectioning, a method offering antigen preservation and superior immunolabeling resolution.
- Live-cell to 3D EM correlation for dynamic studies of intracellular events.
- Cryo-CLEM workflows combining live-cell fluorescence, vitrification, and cryo-TEM or cryo-ET imaging for high-fidelity structure-function studies.
- Large-volume CLEM techniques that permit 3D ultrastructural reconstructions of entire cells or tissues.

These technologies support applications ranging from organelle dynamics and protein localization to disease pathogenesis and drug targeting.
