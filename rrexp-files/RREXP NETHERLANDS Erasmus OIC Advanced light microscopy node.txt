## Erasmus MC OIC â€“ Advanced Light Microscopy Rotterdam Node

---

## Description

The **Erasmus Optical Imaging Centre (OIC)** at **Erasmus MC** in Rotterdam is a core facility of the Euro-BioImaging network, dedicated to advancing high-end optical imaging technologies for biomedical research. As a **Multimodal Imaging Node**, the OIC is a leader in the development and implementation of **quantitative live-cell imaging techniques**, including:

- **Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)**
- **Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)**
- **Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS and FCCS)**
- **Time-lapse imaging**

These technologies are applied to investigate dynamic molecular and cellular processes in living systems, enabling deep functional analysis of cellular behavior in real time.

The Node integrates complementary expertise in **molecular biology, tissue culture, cell biology, animal experimentation, and drug delivery**. Its infrastructure supports:

- High-resolution intracellular imaging
- Precise thermal control for **hyperthermia** and other physiological modulation studies
- In vivo visualization of **intratumoral processes**, particularly in drug delivery and tumor microenvironment manipulation

## Instrument Highlights

The Erasmus OIC hosts an advanced portfolio of imaging systems tailored for high-resolution and live-cell microscopy applications:

**STORM/PALM Super-Resolution Imaging System**  
A hybrid super-resolution platform that combines **Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM)** and **Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (PALM)**, capable of achieving nanometer-scale resolution. The system includes a live-cell incubator, allowing physiological maintenance during long-term super-resolution experiments.

**Deep-UV Laser Confocal Microscopes (Leica SP8)**  
Two confocal systems equipped with **355 nm and 266 nm deep-UV lasers** provide precise **subcellular manipulation**. These are optimized for advanced applications such as **DNA damage and repair studies**, and **organelle injury and regeneration**.

**Spinning Disk Confocal and TIRF Microscopes with Ultra-Fast FRAP Modules**  
Designed for fast imaging of dynamic events, these platforms allow **localized photobleaching** with millisecond resolution. Ideal for mobility studies of membrane-bound and cytoplasmic proteins.
