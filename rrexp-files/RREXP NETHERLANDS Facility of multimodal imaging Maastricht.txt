## Facility of Multimodal Imaging – AMMI Maastricht, The Netherlands

## Description

The Advanced Microscopy and Molecular Imaging (AMMI) Node at Maastricht University combines light and electron microscopy, molecular imaging using mass spectrometry, and non-invasive biomedical imaging technologies. The facility supports both academic and industrial users in molecular, biological, and biomedical imaging. It spans microscopic and macroscopic levels and is integrated into translational research in cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolism, orthopaedics, neurology, and regenerative medicine. The Node collaborates with international research centers and promotes clinically relevant, high-resolution imaging for personalised diagnostics and research translation.

## Instrument Highlights

AMMI provides integrated multimodal platforms for microscopy and whole-body imaging. Key instruments include:

- **Electron Microscopy (EM)**: Scanning and transmission modes with correlative workflows (CLEM), based at the Microscopy Core Lab (Dr. C. Lopez-Iglesias).
- **STED Super-Resolution Microscopy**: Using 592 nm depletion and resonant scanning for sub-diffraction resolution.
- **Confocal Microscopy**: White-light laser and resonant scanning for dynamic in vivo imaging.
- **Two-Photon Microscopy**: Enabled for intravital and FLIM imaging.
- **Whole-Body Imaging**: Used for small animal models in oncology, vascular, and metabolic imaging.

The **Mass Spectrometry Imaging CORE Lab** (Dr. B. Cillero Pastor) provides:

- **High-Resolution MALDI Imaging**: For spatial molecular profiling in tissue.
- **MALDI-2 Postionisation**: Enhances signal detection.
- **Ozone-Induced Dissociation**: Differentiates structural isomers.
- **Nano-ToF-SIMS**: High spatial resolution biomolecular imaging at single-cell level.
- **iKnife**: Mass spectrometry-guided surgical classification of tissue.
- **Laser Microdissection and Cryo-sectioning**: Targeted tissue sampling.
- **Label-Free Proteomics and Native MS**: Enables direct protein analysis.
