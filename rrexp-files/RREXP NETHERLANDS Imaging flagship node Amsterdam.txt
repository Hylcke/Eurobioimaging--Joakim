---

## Description

The Van Leeuwenhoek Center for Advanced Microscopy (LCAM), located in Amsterdam, is a national flagship node within the Euro-BioImaging infrastructure, dedicated to advanced live-cell and functional imaging. It is a collaborative effort between the University of Amsterdam (Faculty of Science - FNWI), the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), and the Amsterdam UMC. LCAM brings together the largest concentration of microscopy experts in the Dutch biomedical landscape.

The node actively develops and integrates custom-built equipment, software solutions, and molecular constructs such as fluorophores, small-molecule dyes, and FRET-based biosensors. These innovations facilitate technically complex and high-resolution studies of molecular and cellular processes in live biological systems. Core applications include dynamic imaging of intracellular signaling, protein-protein interactions, and molecular diffusion in living cells and tissues.

## Instrument Highlights

LCAM houses a diverse array of high-end microscopy platforms tailored for functional and live-cell imaging. These include:

- Confocal systems such as Leica SP8 and Stellaris 8, supporting fast scanning, spectral detection, and environmental control for live samples.
- Super-resolution modalities like STED, PALM, and SIM, used to image structures beyond the diffraction limit.
- Dedicated FLIM-FRET platforms that allow quantification of protein interactions and conformational changes.
- Automated high-content screening systems, enabling large-scale phenotypic assays across multiwell plates.
- Two-photon systems with deep-tissue imaging capabilities for intravital microscopy in organotypic cultures and small animal models.

These instruments are supported by tailored image acquisition software and integrated computational pipelines for downstream image analysis.
