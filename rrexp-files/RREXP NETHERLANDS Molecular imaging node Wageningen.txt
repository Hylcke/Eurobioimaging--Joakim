## Wageningen Imaging and Spectroscopy Hub (WISH) ‚Äì ALM and Molecular Imaging Node Wageningen

## Description

The Wageningen Imaging and Spectroscopy Hub (WISH) ‚Äì ALM and Molecular Imaging Node is a collaborative initiative based at Wageningen University & Research. It brings together three specialized research groups: the Wageningen Light Microscopy Centre (WLMC), the Microspectroscopy Research Facility, and the MAGNEFY Magnetic Resonance Research Facility. These groups collectively contribute expertise in light microscopy, microspectroscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging.

This Node applies cutting-edge imaging technologies specifically to plant research, embedded within a multidisciplinary research environment that includes cell and developmental biologists, biophysicists, and biochemists. Instrumentation has been custom-developed to study *in vivo* photosynthesis using ultrafast fluorescence imaging techniques at single-cell and chloroplast resolution.

## Instrument Highlights

The WISH Node is equipped with specialized instruments for time-resolved and high-resolution imaging. One key asset is the Hamamatsu Streak Camera, used for picosecond-scale time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. This allows detailed monitoring of fast biochemical events, such as solvation dynamics, FRET processes, and the energy transfer mechanisms within photosynthetic complexes.

The Node focuses on spectroscopic and imaging approaches to explore plant biology, including:

- Energy transfer within photosynthetic complexes
- Functional imaging of membrane-bound protein complexes involved in signaling and photosynthesis
- Dynamic visualization of plant developmental processes such as cell division

## Specialties and Expertise of the Node

The Node‚Äôs core strength lies in integrating biophysical and biochemical imaging technologies into plant biology. Areas of expertise include:

- Ultrafast fluorescence imaging for *in vivo* photosynthetic studies
- Single-molecule and high-resolution spectroscopy in living plant systems
- Multimodal imaging combining magnetic resonance, confocal, and spectral techniques

These capabilities enable the study of plant structure and function from molecular to organ level with high temporal and spatial resolution.

## Additional Services

The Node offers:

- Collaborative access to high-end microscopy platforms
- Method development and adaptation for user-specific research needs
- Training and consultation in advanced imaging and spectroscopy methods

Researchers are encouraged to reach out directly for customized access or partnership opportunities.
