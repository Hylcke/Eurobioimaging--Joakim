## Description

The **Norwegian Advanced Light Microscopy Node (NorMIC Oslo)** is a dual-site Euro-BioImaging Node located in Oslo, Norway. It is jointly hosted by the Department of Biosciences at the **University of Oslo (Blindern campus)** and the **Institute for Cancer Research at Oslo University Hospital (Montebello campus)**. 

As part of Norway‚Äôs national imaging infrastructure network, NALMIN, NorMIC Oslo offers advanced light microscopy expertise and services to local, national, and international users. The Node provides imaging solutions for a wide range of biomedical research areas, including **intracellular vesicle trafficking, membrane fusion and fission, cell division, cell migration, and immune cell interactions**. In addition to live-cell imaging, the facility supports high-resolution imaging of fixed samples, integrating microscopy-based cell biology with clinically relevant research questions. 

Through its close affiliation with Helse S√∏r‚Äë√òst (South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority), **NorMIC Oslo fosters translational research** that connects fundamental biological mechanisms with human disease.

## Instrument Highlights

NorMIC Oslo is equipped with a broad range of high-performance light and electron microscopy systems, enabling multiscale imaging from molecular to cellular structures. 

At the **Montebello site**, confocal laser scanning microscopes support super-resolution imaging using **Airyscan and SoRa (Spinning disk super-resolution) modules**. These technologies increase spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit, achieving lateral resolutions near 120‚ÄØnm, and are essential for resolving dynamic processes such as endosomal transport and mitosis in live cells.

**Spinning disk** confocal systems offer rapid imaging with minimal photobleaching, ideal for tracking **fast cellular events** including immune synapse formation and membrane trafficking. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence **(TIRF)** microscopy enables **selective imaging of cellular regions adjacent to the plasma membrane**, enhancing signal-to-noise for studies of vesicle docking or receptor internalisation. 

The Node‚Äôs **electron microscopy platforms** support immuno-gold labelling on Tokuyasu cryosections and resin-embedded samples, allowing precise protein localisation at nanometre resolution. Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) workflows further integrate **fluorescence-based localisation with ultrastructural context**. Temperature- and CO‚ÇÇ-controlled incubators attached to selected microscopes allow **long-term, live-cell imaging** under physiological conditions, supporting applications in migration, cytokinesis, and immune surveillance.

## Additional Services

NorMIC Oslo offers **comprehensive user support across all stages of the imaging pipeline**. 

This includes consultation on experimental design, assistance with probe selection, and access to dedicated wet laboratory and cell culture spaces. Tailored training is available for both entry-level users and advanced researchers, covering foundational microscopy techniques, super-resolution modalities, and sample preparation protocols for electron microscopy.

Expert staff provide on-site assistance during imaging sessions and guide users through image processing, including deconvolution, segmentation, and quantitative analysis. A centralized remote server infrastructure allows users to conduct post-acquisition data analysis off-site, ensuring flexibility and continuity. The Node also accommodates collaborative workflows through sample submission and visiting researcher schemes. Long-term visitors are supported with local housing arrangements, facilitating immersive project development. Workshops and seminars, including virtual options, are offered regularly to support community skill-building in advanced imaging methods.
