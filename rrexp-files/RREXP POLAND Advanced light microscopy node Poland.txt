## Advanced Light Microscopy Node Poland
---
## Description  

The **Polish Advanced Light Microscopy (ALM)** Node is a multi-sited, multimodal imaging infrastructure within the Euro-BioImaging network, providing open access to an extensive range of biological and biomedical imaging technologies. 

It is hosted by three premier research institutions in Poland: 
1. **Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology** of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS) 
2. **Mossakowski Medical Research Centre** PAS in Warsaw
3.  **Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology** at Jagiellonian University in KrakÃ³w. 

The Node offers state-of-the-art instrumentation and technical expertise across advanced light microscopy, correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), electron microscopy (EM), high-throughput imaging, super-resolution microscopy, and functional imaging. These services support diverse scientific disciplines, including **neuroscience, cell biology, developmental biology, and molecular biochemistry**. 

As part of the Euro-BioImaging European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), the Polish ALM Node facilitates cross-border collaboration and standardised access to cutting-edge imaging resources for users across Europe.

The Polish ALM Node hosts an advanced portfolio of imaging platforms designed to support research from **single molecules to tissue-scale investigations**. A key system is the ZEISS Cell Discoverer 7 with the LSM 900 Airyscan 2 detector, which combines **widefield and confocal microscopy in a fully automated environment**. This system allows rapid screening of samples with precise autofocus and barcode-guided sample recognition, and supports high-resolution 3D imaging with improved signal-to-noise ratio and enhanced spatial resolution through the Airyscan module. 

The Node also features Leica Stellaris 5 STED-DLS for **super-resolution and digital light sheet imaging**, which enables sub-diffraction resolution and volumetric imaging of live samples with minimal phototoxicity.

For ultrastructural imaging, the Node provides ZEISS Sigma VP SEM systems equipped with Gatan 3View technology, allowing **automated block-face serial imaging of embedded biological specimens at nanometre resolution**. This approach is critical for reconstructing cellular and subcellular architecture in three dimensions. Additional capabilities include the ONI Nanoimager for **single-molecule localization microscopy** (e.g., PALM/STORM), Zeiss LSM 780/800/900 platforms with spectral and Airyscan detection, high-speed spinning disk confocals, and two-photon microscopes for deep tissue imaging. 

Quantitative phase imaging and laser microdissection systems expand the Nodeâ€™s utility for label-free live-cell studies and precise sample excision, respectively.

## Additional Services  
In addition to providing access to high-end imaging equipment, the Polish ALM Node offers comprehensive **scientific and technical support to internal and external users**. This includes customised methodological consultation, experimental design support, and structured training in sample preparation, image acquisition, and data analysis. **Dedicated wet-lab and tissue culture facilities** are available at each site, alongside microinjection and microdissection laboratories. The Node offers both on-site and remote access, depending on the technology and user needs, allowing for flexible engagement with the platform.

**Training programmes are offered at multiple levels**, ranging from introductory sessions for new users to advanced workshops on specialised imaging techniques, such as super-resolution and electron microscopy. 

**Image analysis support** includes the use of commercial and open-source software packages (e.g., ZEN Blue, Imaris, ARIVIS Vision4D, Huygens), as well as access to custom-built workflows for segmentation, tracking, and quantitative analysis. The Nodeâ€™s team assists users in establishing standard operating procedures and optimising imaging protocols to ensure reproducibility.
