## Description

The **Brain Imaging Network (BIN) Node** in Portugal is a specialised Euro-BioImaging facility dedicated to multimodal neuroimaging, located at the [Portuguese Platform of BioImaging (CIC at Coimbra)](https://www.ppbi.pt) . 

It is hosted by the Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research ([CIBIT](https://www.uc.pt/icnas/cibit/)), integrated within the Institute for Nuclear Sciences Applied to Health ([ICNAS](https://www.uc.pt/en/icnas/)). This single-modality Node focuses on both clinical and preclinical applications of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), with particular emphasis on **neuroscience, oncology, and cardiology**. Through its unique infrastructure and radiopharmaceutical production capabilities, the Node supports translational research spanning early-stage radiotracer development to advanced human imaging studies. 

As part of the Euro-BioImaging infrastructure, the BIN Node provides open access to researchers across Europe, facilitating collaborative projects that advance the understanding of **brain function and disease mechanisms**.

## Instrument Highlights

The **BIN Node** is equipped with cutting-edge **hybrid PET/MR** imaging systems that allow simultaneous acquisition of anatomical, functional, and molecular data within a single imaging session. This capability is particularly valuable for studies requiring high temporal resolution or repeated radiotracer administration, such as **dual PET scans using short-lived Carbon‑11 isotopes**, followed by structural or functional MR sequences. The simultaneous imaging approach increases efficiency, improves image co-registration, and reduces subject movement artifacts.

A key strength of the Node is its **on-site cyclotron and radiopharmacy**, which enable the production of a wide range of PET radiotracers, including Fluorine‑18, Carbon‑11, Gallium‑68, Copper‑64, and Nitrogen‑13. These radionuclides support a diverse array of research applications, from probing neurotransmitter systems in the **brain to tracking metabolic activity in tumours or cardiac tissue**. Custom radiotracer synthesis is available to meet specific scientific objectives.

The MRI facilities include access to experimental "Work-In-Progress" sequences developed in collaboration with **industrial partners**, such as Siemens Healthineers. These include multinuclear MRI techniques that allow imaging of nuclei other than hydrogen (e.g., phosphorus‑31 or sodium‑23), providing additional insight into tissue physiology and metabolism. The Node also offers simultaneous **EEG-fMRI acquisition**, which combines high spatial and temporal resolution to study dynamic brain network activity. Furthermore, it supports **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** inside the MRI bore, enabling real-time investigation of neuromodulation and causal brain connectivity.

The Node is actively involved in technological innovation and validation, including development of a **resistive plate chamber PET system** capable of achieving sub-millimetre resolution, offering enhanced preclinical imaging precision.

## Additional Services

The BIN Node offers a comprehensive suite of scientific and logistical services to facilitate end-to-end project development for both clinical and preclinical imaging studies. Users are supported in **experimental design, regulatory compliance, and clinical trial coordination**. Expert staff assist with radiotracer selection, scanning protocols, and integration of multimodal imaging datasets.

**Data analysis** services include image reconstruction, quantification, and modelling, with dedicated tools for simultaneous PET/MR processing and EEG–fMRI artefact correction. The Node also offers machine learning-based analysis pipelines to explore high-dimensional imaging data. Secure infrastructure is in place for data storage and long-term archiving, ensuring reproducibility and compliance with data governance standards.

The facility **supports recruitment of human research participants** through affiliated clinical networks, and offers in-house housing for laboratory animals for longitudinal or multi-modal preclinical studies. Radiopharmacy services are available for custom tracer production and experimental validation. Educational activities include hands-on training in PET and MRI methodology, as well as advanced courses on neuroimaging and hybrid modalities. **Remote collaboration**, sample submission, and data analysis consultation can be arranged to accommodate external users and cross-institutional projects.
