## Description

The **Barcelona Mesoscopic Imaging Node (BMIN)** is a Flagship Euro-BioImaging facility jointly operated by **IRBâ€¯Barcelona** and **ICFO**, and hosted within the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology in Spain. This Node provides open access to state-of-the-art mesoscopic imaging platforms, centered on **advanced Lightsheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM)**. Instruments span scales from tens of micrometres to multiple centimetres, enabling high-speed, deep-volume imaging of entire organs and live whole organisms with cellular resolution. 

**BMIN supports public and private sector researchers** through custom-tailored workflows that begin with project design and extend through sample preparation, image acquisition, data analysis, and visualization.

### Unique Capabilities:
- **Multiscale optical imaging**, from **50 Âµm to 5+ cm**.
- **Live imaging of whole organisms and organs**.
- **High-speed and deep imaging capabilities**.
- **In toto imaging with cellular resolution**.

## Instrument Highlights

The Node incorporates **multiple specialized LSFM configurations to address diverse mesoscopic imaging challenges**. 

**SPIM (Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy)** delivers fast, gentle optical sectioning suited to live and cleared specimens. **MultiView SPIM **facilitates isotropic three-dimensional reconstructions via multi-angle acquisition. Double-sided illumination and detection enhance imaging depth and uniformity in large specimens. **Digitally Scanned Lightsheet Microscopy (DSLM)** improves contrast and spatial resolution by scanning a thin laser sheet. **Axially Swept Lightsheet Microscopy (ASLM)** maintains high axial resolution throughout large volume fields. **Oblique Plane Microscopy (OPM)** supports samples in conventional multiwell plates. Refocused imaging combined with adaptive optics enables rapid volumetric imaging in dynamic biological systems. **MacroSPIM** extends capabilities to intact organs up to 30â€¯mm, particularly when paired with tissue clearing methods. 

**Diverging and Scattered Lightsheet** techniques enable label-free visualization of whole organisms or fibrous structures, addressing biological questions such as developmental dynamics and nanoparticle distribution.
