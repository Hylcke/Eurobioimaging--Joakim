# Barcelona Super‚ÄëResolution Light and Nanoscopy Node (SLN@BCN)

---

## Description

The **Barcelona Super‚ÄëResolution Light and Nanoscopy Node (SLN@BCN)** integrates two leading bioimaging facilities in Barcelona‚Äîthe **Super‚Äëresolution Light Microscopy and Nanoscopy facility at ICFO (Institute of Photonic Sciences)** and the **Advanced Light Microscopy Unit at CRG (Centre for Genomic Regulation)**. Located respectively in Castelldefels and the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park, the alliance offers open-access services in advanced imaging and plays a pivotal role within the Euro‚ÄëBioImaging network‚Äôs single-technology super-resolution node. 

The Node operates at the interdisciplinary interface of photonics, life sciences, engineering, and data analysis, providing both cutting-edge infrastructure and methodological expertise. It supports external fundamental, translational, and industrial research in biological and medical imaging, while advancing the development of novel super-resolution techniques.

## Instrument Highlights

### **STORM System**
The Node features a **Nikon N‚ÄëSTORM** setup based on a motorized inverted Ti‚ÄëE platform, equipped with four laser lines (405, 488, 561, and 647 nm), high-sensitivity EMCCD and sCMOS detectors, and a cage-stage incubator for live-cell experimentation. It supports multiple super-resolution modalities including classic STORM, dSTORM, PALM, and DNA‚ÄëPAINT, offering lateral resolutions down to ~20‚ÄØnm and axial resolution around ~50‚ÄØnm. Environmental control systems ensure stable temperature, humidity, and CO‚ÇÇ during prolonged acquisitions.

### **STED System (Leica)**
The **Leica TCS SP8 FALCON STED 3X** system achieves three-dimensional stimulated emission depletion microscopy using 592 nm and 660 nm continuous-wave depletion lasers alongside a 775 nm pulsed depletion source. It integrates the FALCON photoluminescence and fluorescence lifetime imaging module, enabling video-rate lifetime quantification on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Resonant scanning capability with white-light laser excitation and a 405 nm diode facilitates rapid imaging under controlled environmental conditions. Post-acquisition deconvolution is performed using Huygens software.

### **STED System (Abberior)**
An **Abberior STED** installation on the Olympus IX83 platform incorporates four pulsed excitation lasers at 485, 518, 561, and 640 nm, in addition to a continuous-wave 405 nm laser. It features dual STED depletion lasers (595 and 775 nm), a MATRIX array detector for enhanced signal-to-background ratio, and avalanche photodiodes optimized for ultrahigh-sensitivity fluorescence lifetime imaging.

### **Airyscan System**
The **Zeiss LSM980 Airyscan 2** system, complemented by Definite Focus 2, integrates multiple excitation lines (405, 488, 561, 639 nm) and Airyscan multiplex mode. It achieves an improved lateral resolution (~120 nm) across a range of immersion objectives (silicon, water, glycerol, oil). Environmental chambers maintain live-cell culture conditions during long-term time-lapse experiments.

These instruments collectively accommodate **high-resolution studies of subcellular architecture**, dynamic tracking of molecular complexes, functional interaction mapping, and real-time analysis of live biological systems, spanning applications in cell biology, neuroscience, and photonics-driven nanomedicine.

## Additional Services

**SLN@BCN** supports users through the full experimental workflow. Experts provide assistance in experimental design, protocol drafting, and development of standard operating procedures tailored to super-resolution imaging. 

Hands-on training covers both basic microscopy and advanced image analysis, including remote user support. Researchers can access **biosafety-compliant BSL-1 and BSL-2 cell culture laboratories**, as well as wet lab facilities. Mechanical and electronic prototyping workshops support the development of customized sample holders and experimental devices. 

**Industrial-grade server infrastructure** ensures secure data storage and transfer, and staff offer complete image analysis pipelines leveraging advanced software for STORM, STED, FLIM, FRET, FRAP, and image scanning outputs. Training workstations and seminar rooms support theoretical instruction, and logistical support enables hosting of visiting users. Collaborative access extends to academic, industrial, hospital, and Euro‚ÄëBioImaging network partners.
