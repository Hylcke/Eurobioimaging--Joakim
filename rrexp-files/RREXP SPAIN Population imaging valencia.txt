## Description
**Population Imaging Valencia** is hosted by the Biomedical Imaging Research Group (GIBI230) within the **La‚ÄØFe Health Research Institute** (IIS La‚ÄØFe) in Valencia, Spain. The Node operates through the Experimental Radiology and Imaging Biomarkers Platform (PREBI) and serves as a national centre of excellence for **computational biomedical imaging**. 

GIBI230 integrates clinical, radiological, and molecular data to develop reproducible imaging biomarkers, using radiomics, artificial intelligence, and large-scale data harmonisation frameworks. 

**The Node supports multi-centre observational studies and interventional clinical trials** across oncology, neurology, and personalised medicine. Its infrastructure enables the creation of structured and interoperable image repositories mapped to ontologies such as ICD-10, SNOMED, and RxNorm, and aligned with the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) for data integration and cross-study analytics. 

As part of Euro-BioImaging, the Node offers population-level imaging solutions and federated AI capabilities for real-world biomedical research.

## Instrument Highlights

### **Computational biology**  
The Node is equipped with a high-performance compute node featuring **2√ó NVIDIA¬Æ DGX A100‚Ñ¢ GPUs**, purpose-built for deep learning and AI-driven image analysis. This platform is designed to accelerate neural network training and inference tasks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformer-based architectures, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Complementing the compute node is a high-capacity **SERVER SIE LADON GBT CDL 6230 A** storage server, which supports high-throughput workflows and secure data archiving.

### **Clinical imaging:**  
For clinical imaging, the facility operates a **GE Healthcare Signa PET/MR system**, which combines a 3 Tesla MRI scanner with a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based PET detector in a **60‚ÄØcm bore**. This system enables simultaneous acquisition of functional and structural data, allowing accurate co-localisation of metabolic and anatomical features. The PET/MR platform is essential for applications in oncology (e.g., tumour grading, therapy monitoring), neurology (e.g., dementia, epilepsy), and cardiology.

The Node also houses a **Philips Achieva TX 3T MRI system**, equipped with multi-transmission RF technology and a **60‚ÄØcm central tunnel**. This system supports advanced MRI techniques including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging, and spectroscopy, with customisable pulse sequences tailored for both clinical diagnostics and research protocols.

For preclinical studies, the Node employs the **Bruker Albira Si micro-PET/CT** scanner, which provides high-resolution, multimodal imaging in small animal models. The system combines PET and CT imaging in a single platform, enabling detailed molecular and anatomical assessments for oncology, neurobiology, and pharmacological research. The integration of radiotracer quantification and anatomical localisation facilitates translational research between preclinical and clinical domains.

## Additional Services
**Population Imaging Valencia** offers comprehensive support for biomedical researchers and clinical partners, including **study design, protocol development, and regulatory support for clinical trials**. The Node provides end-to-end services in image acquisition, radiomics processing, AI model development, and data interpretation. 

Users have access to federated learning infrastructures that allow collaborative analysis across institutions while preserving data privacy under GDPR compliance. The Node also supports daily **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes for real-time integration of radiology, pathology, and laboratory data, mapped to international standards and ontologies.

Further services include **anatomical 3D printing from imaging data** for surgical planning and educational use, as well as practical training in interventional radiology using animal models. Customised workshops and remote access for advanced data analytics and distributed AI deployment are available upon request. 

PREBI also serves as a hub for cross-platform harmonisation of image datasets and hosts over 300 clinical trials, underscoring its critical role in translational medicine and imaging biomarker validation.
