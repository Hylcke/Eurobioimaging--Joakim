## Swedish National Microscopy Infrastructure (NMI)

---

## Description

The **Swedish National Microscopy Infrastructure (NMI)** is a distributed Euro-BioImaging Node composed of five thematically specialised and technologically advanced imaging centres located in **Stockholm, Uppsala, Gothenburg, Umeå, and Lund**. Founded in 2016 with support from the Swedish Research Council, NMI operates as Sweden’s national platform for biological and biomedical imaging. It is **coordinated centrally by the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)** in Stockholm, which also manages a unified entry portal for user access and project allocation.

The mission of NMI is to provide researchers with access to state-of-the-art imaging instrumentation, technical support, and data analysis tools that address the needs of fundamental and translational life science research. Each of the five centres contributes domain-specific capabilities, enabling multimodal, high-resolution, and quantitative imaging across biological length and time scales. **NMI serves more than 500 national and international users annually** and functions as Sweden’s representative within the broader Euro-BioImaging network, enhancing Europe-wide accessibility to cutting-edge microscopy and imaging expertise.

## Instrument Highlights

The Swedish NMI Node integrates a comprehensive suite of advanced imaging modalities across its participating sites. 

At **KTH in Stockholm**, researchers can access **lattice light-sheet microscopy** for gentle, rapid volumetric imaging in live 3D samples, as well as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy **(FCS and FCCS)** for measuring molecular dynamics. The site also supports **CODEX (CoDetection by Indexing)**, a high-dimensional imaging technique that enables simultaneous detection of over 40 biomarkers within a single tissue sample.

The Centre for **Cellular Imaging (CCI) in Gothenburg** offers **correlative multimodal imaging**, combining **fluorescence microscopy**, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry-based imaging **(e.g., MALDI-IMS)**. This site also enables high-throughput microscopy for screening large-scale sample sets. 

At Umeå University, the **Biochemical Imaging Centre Umeå (BICU)** and **Umeå Core Facility for Electron Microscopy (UCEM)** provide access to **cryo-electron tomography**, serial section transmission electron microscopy **(TEM)**, and integrated workflows for correlative light and electron microscopy **(CLEM)**.

The Intravital Microscopy facility at **Stockholm University** enables live-animal imaging using **intravital fluorescence and FLIM techniques** within a purpose-built animal facility. 

**Uppsala’s BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF)** specialises in **advanced image analysis**, **spatial transcriptomics**, and **deep-learning-assisted quantification** pipelines, with a strong emphasis on training and software development. 

The **Live Cell Imaging Core Facility at Karolinska Institutet** supports **time-lapse imaging** and **lattice structured illumination microscopy **for studying live cells in three dimensions. 

At **Lund University, the Bioimaging Centre (LBIC)** provides multimodal imaging capabilities including **MRI and microCT platforms**, supporting both basic and preclinical research.

**NMI** uniquely offers cryo-CLEM integrated with focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy **(cryo-FIB-SEM)**, automated zebrafish imaging systems for developmental biology, and **Airy-beam light-sheet microscopy** for high-resolution volumetric imaging in thick biological specimens.

## Additional Services

**NMI** delivers a **full-service user experience ranging from experimental planning and protocol consultation to sample preparation, image acquisition, data processing, and image interpretation**. All centres provide access to biosafety level 2 wet lab spaces, cell culture facilities, and high-performance computing environments tailored for large-volume data processing. Fixed sample submission is available for remote users.

The **BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF) in Uppsala offers dedicated support for custom software development, deep learning integration, and quantitative image analysis**. Training opportunities include hands-on courses, weekly drop-in sessions, and EMBO-level workshops for both novice and advanced users. Facility staff also offer guided imaging for complex experiments, along with methodological support for SOP generation, statistical analysis, and reproducibility assurance.

**Staff-assisted imaging and train-the-trainer programmes are available at most sites**, ensuring that visiting scientists receive expert instruction and access to institutional knowledge. Collaborative long-term project models can be arranged for users conducting extended or technically demanding investigations.
